## Contributing
TypeScript is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved ("Milestone == Community") by the TypeScript team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you’ve submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

New samples will not be accepted at this time.

Download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.docx](https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=typescript&DownloadId=822190)), sign, scan, and email it back to <cla@microsoft.com>.
